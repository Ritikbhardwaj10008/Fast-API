# we have to include the router and define whatever the router we want to give(in this we are giving the router present in blog)




# we need to store all the request body into the database

    # how do we delete anything from the sql alchemy

#    âœ… How SQLAlchemy works:
#    You want to...	           You write
#    Get all rows	           db.query(Model).all()
#    Filter rows	           db.query(Model).filter(...).all()
#    Delete rows	           db.query(Model).filter(...).delete()
#    Add a new row	           db.add(obj)
